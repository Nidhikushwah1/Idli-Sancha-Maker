# Idli-Sancha-Maker
Idli Sancha Maker is a Java-based console application that calculates the size and requirements of customized commercial idli trays and tray racks based on user input. It helps determine tray fitting, masala quantity, and volume calculations â€” making it easier to design idli-making setups.

Idli Sancha Maker is a simple console-based Java application designed to help commercial kitchens or food equipment manufacturers calculate the specifications of idli trays and tray racks. Based on user inputs, it checks whether the tray size fits standard rack sizes and then calculates how much masala (batter) is required for a single deep, one tray, and the entire tray rack. This project is part of an internship practice program and focuses on applying core Java concepts to solve a real-world problem.

ðŸ§° Technologies Used
Core Java (No external libraries or frameworks)

ðŸ”§ Features
Takes input for tray size and checks if it fits into one of the three standard tray rack sizes:

18 inch (Small)

24 inch (Medium)

36 inch (Large)

Automatically calculates:

Whether the tray fits into the selected rack

Volume of a single deep, one tray, and the entire tray rack

Required amount of masala (idli batter) and water based on volume (assuming the density is equal to that of nut oil)

Valid deep count rules:

Small tray (18 inch): 4 to 6 deeps

Medium tray (24 inch): 8 to 10 deeps

Large tray (36 inch): 16 deeps only
